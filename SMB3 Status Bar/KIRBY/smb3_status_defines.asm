;  will be free to use for a custom sprite tile. the item box position will be
;  handled by the !itembox define above as it's now treated as a regular counter.
;  the item box tiles and properties are handled below
;3 means the item box will be a 16x16 layer 3 image. similarly to setting 2,
;  !sprite0_YX and !sprite0_PT are free to use. likewise, the item box position is
;  handled by the !itembox define above, but similar to a 2-tile-high bonus star
;  counter in that !itembox has the top 2 tiles and !itembox+$20 has the bottom 2.
;  the tiles/properties themselves are handled below, though only the first tile (top-left)
;  is referenced; the other 3 tiles will follow this one, similar to the player icon.
;  (aka if top-left is $24, then top-right is $25, bottom-left $26, and bottom-right $27)
;  properties are the same for all 4 tiles
