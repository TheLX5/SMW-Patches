**********************************
* Old Changes                    *
**********************************

(ver 2.05)
1. You can insert different multiple midway "bars" in each sublevel(room). See "midway instruction/custom_bar.png".
2. The prompt does not mess up your layer 3 BG, or some color math such as transparent foreground. Most HDMA effects (except windows effects, etc.) will work properly without being broken by the prompt.
3. New options (retry_table.asm)
- resetting RNG
- counterbreak yoshis/powerups/coins (now you don't have to get separate patch for this)
- midway powerup
4. This patch saves the midway state to SRAM for non SA-1 ROMs.
5. Compatible with new LM's secondary entrances (#0200-#1FFF)
6. Fixed a vanilla glitch that the interaction with layer 2 objects is incorrect at the first frame when you enter a level.
7. Fixed a glitch that the last midway bar (that should not be respawned) is respawned when you enter another level and come back to the level.

* NOTE: For the sake of sustainability, this patch does no longer support Multiple Midway Point patch by Kaijyuu and LX5.
        Also, the new "custom midway bar" feature can do everything what the MMP patch does.

(ver 2.04)
1. Provides new multiple midway options: now each midway bar in each sublevel can point different places. See "retry_table.asm" and the figures in the "midway instruction" folder.
2. Lets you espace a level by start+select if the auto reset option is used, i.e. !default_prompt_type = $02, or $03 for the local settings.
3. Fixed the sample loading glitch that happened when you use addmusick and the option "!default_prompt_type = $01 or $02".
4. Fixed the no yoshi intro glitch that referred to a wrong table position.
5. Provides more options regarding counterbreak and etc. in "retry_table.asm".
6. Made the pipe checkpoints save the lock status($9D) for consistency.
7. Fixed the glitch that the prompt didn't pop up when you die to a muncher while climbing and holding a directional input(thanks to The Biob for the report).


(ver 2.03) FIRST RELEASED
1. Now supports SA-1.
2. Fixed the glitch that sometimes miscalculated the address of the non-vanilla midway table added by LM's hack.
3. Some minor polishing.


(ver 2.02)
1. ON/OFF status is now reset properly. (Thanks NeXuS15 for reporting this)
2. Fixed the graphical issues in the boss battles. (Thanks NeXus15)
3. Fixed the issue that the "no retry prompt" option overlooked the "default" system of extra checkpoints.


(ver 2.01)
1. Handled the special cases(titlescreen, intro, yoshi wing bonus) which didn't work properly in the last version.
   (Thanks NeXuS15)
2. Fixed the glitch that choosing the retry option may send players to an arbitrary sublevel after getting a custom midway of MMP.
   (Thanks turbofa)
3. Fixed the glitch which may bring you to a random level whose initial flag of "Midway point obtained" is checked in LM.
4. Make more things reset properly; directional coins from a question box, side exit flag, flying turn block flag, etc.


(ver 2.00)
1. Fixed the issue that a green yoshi(directly put on the level) didn't appear.
2. Fixed the bonus game problem which activated the screen exit of FF on a vertical level.
3. Now compatible with vanilla midway entrances. You may turn off the "Use separate settings for Midway Entrance" option.
4. The status of the door/pipe checkpoints will be preserved even when you exit to the map.
5. Added more options to the prompt(skip/sfx/lives). See "retry_table.asm".
6. Optimized the sample loading schedule; resetting a level may be faster than the past if you're using AddmusicK.
7. Now compatible with "Multiple Midway Point 1.6" (by Kaijyuu and LX5).
